## Want this polished with real links, badges, and screenshots?
I tried to read your existing README from the repository but could not access it from my environment. To finish finalizing this README (add exact skills, badges, repo links, demos, screenshots, and replace placeholders), I need one of the following:
- Make the repo public temporarily so I can fetch README content, or
- Paste your current README content here, or
- Provide these details below.

Please provide the items below (paste or answer succinctly) and I’ll produce the final polished README with real links, badges, screenshots, and short project descriptions.

1) Preferred display name and a 1‑line bio to show at the top.  
2) Current role / availability (e.g., "Senior Full‑Stack Engineer — Open to opportunities").  
3) Exact top skills/tech (6–12 items, in order).  
4) Repo URLs and 1–2 line descriptions for:
   - Vidthread
   - Zoogy
   - Your realtime backend project (repo name + link)
5) Demo or deployed links (if any) and screenshot URLs/GIFs.  
6) Social/contact links (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Website, Email).  
7) Any badges/stats you want included (e.g., GitHub languages, streak, downloads).  
8) Tone preference (friendly, professional, concise, playful).  
9) Profile picture and banner URLs (optional).  
10) Any other projects you want highlighted or milestones/awards to call out.

Once you share these, I’ll update the README in place and provide the final Markdown ready to paste into your repo. If you want, I can also generate individual README templates for Vidthread, Zoogy, and the realtime backend.
